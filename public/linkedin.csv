I've spent the last ~3 years leading design at Studio (formerly Monthly), where we provide hands on, cohort based classes taught by your favorite creators including Kygo, Charlie Puth, Christina Tosi, Mark Rober, Casey Neistat and more. As the founding designer at seed stage, I led design on many 0 to 1 initiatives that would eventually becomes foundations for new experiences. As we grew and evolved into a Series B company, I helped recruit, manage and empower a team of 4 while still contributing as an IC.

I'm currently looking for my next adventure as either a lead level IC or managing and leading a design team. I thrive in environments where problems are ambiguous, the opportunity areas are endless, and the impact that design can have is immense.

I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and humanity — the ways in which technology shapes and will continue to shape our lives, and how we may harness it for the better. 

I bring a strong technical background in both theory and practice, currently working as an APM at Uber on Driver Experience. I graduated from Harvard with a dual Bachelor's-Master's degree in Applied Math and Computer Science, and I have taken on several Software Engineering internships in industry, including at Facebook and Mastercard.

At the same time, I am greatly focused on people and impact. As a former Fiction Board Member of Harvard's literary magazine and Associate News Editor of the school newspaper, I also bring a creative bent to my work, imagining worlds unseen and grappling with the nuances of the human experience.

The technology exists to decarbonize the world — it's just too difficult for companies to deploy today. Watershed's software platform changes that, helping companies measure their carbon impact. We show decision-makers across the company where every kilogram of carbon comes from so they can make a precise, year-by-year plan to aggressively reduce it, and share the results with investor-grade reporting.

We work with the most ambitious companies on their climate programs, including Stripe, Shopify, Airbnb, Square, and more. We’re growing fast and hiring across the board! Come join us!

At MHacks VI, a 1500 person hackathon hosted by the University of Michigan, my team built a system to allow people who do not have access to the internet (either because they own a feature phone, or internet is not available in their area) to still access internet-connected applications by leveraging the power of SMS and the cloud. We used Twilio to create an accessible phone number that users can text. A server running on Microsoft Azure is set up to listen to the webhooks associated with this phone number and will pull any new text messages from Twilio. These texts are parsed and new application instances are started. A core framework is provided that will provide the parsed commands to an application which can do anything a normal internet-connected application would do, and will return the application's results to the user via text messages. On the developer end, we created a full featured web-based IDE and app store that provide developers with an area to create applications on top of our core framework and immediately deploy them to AWS courtesy of real-time syncing via Firebase. standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ Algorithms CMSC351 Applied Probability and Statistics STAT400 Applied Probability and Statistics II STAT401 Calculus III MATH241 Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications Computer Science Honors Seminar CMSC396H Developing Data Products 8 2012 5 2014 Calculus, Physics and Chemistry Tutor Towson High School EDUCATION Amazon Web Services (AWS) Leadership Gannon Portal Scholarship This scholarship recognizes outstanding computer science undergraduates early in their studies.

At Hack the Planet, we developed Haptic Web Developer which utilizes the cutting-edge Sensel to allow anyone to draw out their websites and instantly deploy to AWS. Utilizing tapping, swiping, and dragging motions, you are able to add text boxes, shaped regions, and images to a web layout.
In order to develop this project, our team developed a gesture framework in Python (similar to Gesture Recognizers for iOS) that could convert the raw data that the Sensel registered into different gestures such as taps and pans. From here, we built a Python application using Tkinter that showed the user what they were drawing. Once the user was finished, we developed a method for automatically converting the drawn content into HTML using a cutting-edge CSS grid system and completely scripted  the process of deploying to AWS. standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ Mobile Education Hub 5 2015 5 2015 Awarded: 3rd Place and KPCB Build for Good Challenge

The Mobile Education Hub was a hackathon project built at RevolutionUC (University of Cincinnati's annual MLH-sponsored hackathon). This project addresses a ""Build-for-Good""​ challenge released by KPCB and Pencils of Promise. Pencils of Promise is an organization that makes tremendous impact by vastly improving education in developing communities throughout the world. This hub allows Pencils of Promise educators to create innovative and interactive multimedia courses using the OpenEdx platform. This hub does not rely on the internet, so it is well-fit for 3rd world countries where a lack of a reliable connection is commonplace. Instead, the hub is designed to spread courses via it's own local area network. Each hub is made up of a Raspberry Pi B+ running a custom-made OpenEdx image and an Arduino hooked to a GSM modem to create SMS-based discussion forums. Each hub is completely self-operational and can function without anything other than a power source (which can come in the form of solar power). standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ standardizedContributor Hiroshi Furuya Trustees Doctoral Fellow at University of Central Florida Discrete Structures CMSC250 Exploratory Data Analysis Foundations in Cybersecurity HACS100 Foundations in Cybersecurity II HACS102 Intro to Computer Science II - Summer class at Towson University Introduction to Computer Systems CMSC216 Introduction to Statistical Computing with SAS STAT430 MongoDB for Node.js Developers M101JS Object-Oriented Programming II CMSC132 Oral Communication INAG110 Organization of Programming Languages CMSC330 Practical Machine Learning R Programming Project Management Swift OCaml Objective-C HTML CSS C Cybersecurity Software Engineering React Best Use of Intel Edison Development System at PennApps XI (SmartCan) PennApps is the premier student-run college hackathon.

We get our daily information from clickbaity newsfeeds, social media echo chambers, and mindless-scroll products riddled with low-nutrient content.

Depending on professional journalists isn't much better -- they're subject to corporate bias and political agendas, they make the news boring by focusing only on ""headline-worthy"" issues, and their final product is a wall of text that busy people skim rather than read thoroughly.

Our children spend hours a day browsing videos on TikTok, whose parent company openly sends user data to the Chinese government -- a clear national security threat that few people seem to be sufficiently concerned about.

But unlike the traditional media cycle, it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom for our society.

At Shades, we're building a product that provides a healthy information diet, while still being entertaining and fun:
- You see quick summaries of multiple points of view -- fast, comprehensive, and balanced.
- You see a wide variety of topics, from cultural trends to politics to sports to movies to science.
- You can share your own takes and opinions, and see how they evolve over time.

You should follow my LinkedIn page here if you're interested in boosting your own information diet, or that of your children. I post about the future of news and information -- the problems with the current options, and how we can fix them.

Accessible systems thinker.

Designing with a user centered focus to ensure that users’ wants and needs are at the forefront of the design process. Passionate about accessible design, ensuring all potential users have equal opportunities regardless of ability, prior opportunities, experiences, or skillsets. I am not an expert (regarding accessibility), I just really care. 

Experienced in design systems building accessible, scalable components to be deployed across products with documentation. Proficient with WCAG guidelines and screen reader annotations for VoiceOver and TalkBack, but striving to learn more. Currently focused on learning and improving localization alongside accessibility concerns. Tackling design through accessibility lenses and accounting for all, including environmental and situational disabilities.

Always seeking opportunities to grow as an individual and designer alongside my peers.

See above project for more details. DubsTech 5 2020 Washington State Opportunity Scholarship Recipient 4-year recipient of the WSOS scholarship. WSOS reduces barriers to education and training and facilitates entry into high-demand careers by supporting low and middle income Washington students pursuing high-demand majors in science, technology, engineering, math (STEM), or health care. Washington State Opportunity Scholarship 9 2018 Homemore 2 2021 3 2021 Homelessness is a major issue that has swept the United States and they are often underserved by services. Disabled people, people who use drugs, and minors/vulnerable populations often find themselves without a safe home.

Access to medical services is also crucial, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we wanted to design a service that would allow people to see where free medical services were offered, and other helpful resources.

Many people might find the idea of building an app for the homeless contradictory, but a large percentage the homeless population own cell phones that serve as a lifeline and allow them to search for resources. Mobile phone ownership by homeless individuals ranged from 44%-62% in 2016. There are existing apps designed for a non-homeless person to aid homeless people. However, Homemore is an app designed FOR the homeless individual to help themselves.

Electrochromic materials that readily change color as a function of voltage are ideal candidates for dynamic window applications. Unfortunately, these materials have yet to be widely commercialized due to complications and tradeoffs associated with color, switching speed, durability, and cost. In this work, we study the reversible metal electrodeposition of Bi and Cu on a Pt-functionalized transparent conducting electrode for high-quality dynamic windows. We develop a stoichiometrically optimized electrolyte formula to construct 25 cm2 electrochromic devices with bistable, reversibly tunable transmission at fast switching speeds. Our results show improved deposition uniformity and sheet resistance achieved with the Pt-modified cathode, and our colorless electrolyte enables great optical performance. Altogether, our windows demonstrate uniform switching between a clear state, with over 70% transmission, and a color-neutral black state, with under 15% transmission. Additionally, our electrochromic devices can be cycled in less than one minute, demonstrating a significant improvement over previous metal-based dynamic window architectures. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford '19 Handwritten Mathematics to LaTeX Code 4 2018 6 2018 In this study, we present a fully end-to-end, deep learning pipeline capable of generating the LaTeX code associated with an input mathematical image. The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture with integrated visual and semantic attention mechanisms. For model training, we leverage a rich dataset of over 100,000 LaTeX images linked to their ground truth markup. Metrics such as Levenshtein distance and BLEU score were used to assess performance and compare between models. We managed to achieve a BLEU score of 56% and image edit accuracy of 48%. Our image-to-LaTeX system could benefit students, researchers, and professors alike by saving them valuable time spent transcribing work from paper to PDF. Such a system might aid in the development of next-generation grading systems and artificially intelligent notetakers for students with documented disabilities.

Quantitative Researcher at Citadel Securities Prediction of Cellular Service Quality 10 2016 12 2017 Used ordinary least squares, support vector regression, and random forest regression to predict the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) of mobile devices. Achieved a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15.5 dB on RSSI test data ranging from 0 to 250 dB in magnitude.

Current mobile devices can tell us when a cell signal or WiFi connection is weak; however, they fail to provide useful information for obtaining a better signal. A compact machine learning model, capable of predicting RSSI from real-time network conditions and location measurements, could provide mobile device users with a personal heuristic for locating areas of optimal cell service.

This could also benefit cell service providers in determining a favorable deployment of cell towers over a region. As cell carrier companies work to improve their coverage by using insights obtained via this predictive algorithm, periodically retraining the model to reflect these targeted improvements results in a positive feedback loop to benefit mobile device users all over the world. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford '19 Tetris AI 9 2017 12 2017 In this project, we take a reinforcement learning approach to play the game of Tetris. By modeling the game states in terms of the board and current tetromino, we use TD Learning and genetic algorithms to determine an evaluation function for picking the best possible move at each step. We built six different agents to test combinations of depth-k search, feature selection, TD learning, and genetic algorithms. Our top-performing model was depth-2 search using the evaluation function found by genetic algorithm. This model was able to clear over 6,000 lines, beating out even the best human players. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford '19 Applied Matrix Theory MATH 104 Applied Quantum Mechanics EE 222, 223 Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques CS 221 Circuits EE 101A, 101B Computer Organization and Systems CS 107 Computers, Ethics, and Public Policy CS 181W Convex Optimization EE 364A C# Python H.

The application enabled students to anonymously share their current feelings with others on campus. Their feelings are geolocated onto a map alongside a timestamp. Then our NLP sentiment analyzer would determine the feeling's sentiment to create a color-code for the geo-stamp. This creates a colored map of campus expressing the feelings of individual students. 

Due to the increasingly important issue of mental health on college campuses, this application is intended to allow students to share their feelings anonymously with others on campus, show students that they are not alone. The facade of the perfect Stanford student (Stanford Duck Syndrome) means that real emotions and struggles are often suppressed. It is heartwarming to be able to connect with people on campus and see how they feel, in a familiar, yet anonymous way. standardizedContributor Cooper de Nicola Stanford Computer Science B.S., M.S. | Cyber Security 1792 Stanford University https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQHr9suxyJBXMw/company-logo_400_400/0/1635534378574?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=n9zW0hQ5iti-5mWACcvhev1jNx1tQmvV-6eofG1ETX8 https://www.linkedin.com/school/stanford-university/ 10001 9 2020 Stanford, California, United States 9 2020 Stanford University Head course assistant for Stanford’s intro cyber security technology, law, and policy course.

• Led the development of a metrics platform, which manages hundreds of defined metrics, utilizing a Java spring boot gRPC service with graphQL query support for data fetching, dbt for data preparation executed in Airflow DAGs, and Python for job logic. Worked directly with several partner engineering teams to ensure the platform met their needs and helped them onboard their metrics. Resulted in a low-friction format for defining metrics and a unified system for handling data preparation and querying. The platform handles several million API requests per day with p99 latency of under 1s.

• Led the design and development of a scheduled reporting service, using Java microservices, gRPC, and Temporal to execute report generation workflows.

• Acted as the main developer on graphQL APIs for web UI reporting capabilities, such as configurable dashboards for viewing grouped and filtered performance metrics data, used by clients to understand the performance of their text message and email marketing campaigns.

• Acted as a mentor for engineers on my immediate team and across the engineering organization.

• Experience working with Terraform for infrastructure management, Helm for Kubernetes service deployments, Apache Flink and Spark for event data ETL pipelines, s3 and PostgresSQL for data storage, and Snowflake for data warehousing.

📚 My name is Yashvi, and I am a junior pursuing a dual major in Computer Science and Business Administration along with a double minor in Entrepreneurship and Philosophy.

🤔 I enjoy problem solving and get super excited about building tech for consumer products. I have worked with numerous startups such as Tour.Video and UniFlow, and larger companies like Slack (Salesforce) as a software engineer. I have also been a volunteer with iSPIRT - India's think and do tank that is driving 30 years orbit shifts in tech-policy.

🎲 Outside of my work, I enjoy reading (currently reading Fountainhead by Ayn Rand), playing cards and board games, and going to the beach.

💬 Feel free to contact me about social impact, startups, or technology. I'm always excited to meet new people!

Oberoi International School 8 2017 Table for Four -- HackSC 2 2021 2 2021 Drawing inspiration from the New York Time’s article on the “36 Questions to Fall in Love” and the classic board-game Sequence, this digital board game – Table for Four – is built for sparking deeper conversations and creating meaningful connections.

Similar to Sequence, the motive of the game is to create 4-token sequences across the board with your assigned team-member. The catch: we’ve replaced the deck of cards with a deck of meaningful questions that you have to answer in order to proceed! While the end-goal may be competitive, the beauty in this game is the journey to get there – The more detailed your answer, the more follow-ups; the more follow-ups, the more chances for other players to share their answers too; and the more sharing, the greater the conversation.

We also wanted to make sure this game could apply to anyone! From college friends to distant family, we’ve got a version for all types of company you might keep. The current version available is called ""Recess,"" which is built specifically for friends of all ages. Other versions we hope to work on soon are: ""No Strings Attached"" for not super personal but still interesting conversations; ""Dinner Table"" for family-friendly / family-focused bonding time; ""Cupid’s Arrows"" for couples; and ""Saturday Nights"" as our 18+/party-setting deck. standardizedContributor Yashvi Jaju CS, Business, Philosophy at USC | Kleiner Perkins Fellow 2022 | Incoming SWE Intern at Two Sigma | President at TroyLabs | Previously at Slack Smart Tic Tac Toe 8 2020 12 2020 standardizedContributor Yashvi Jaju CS, Business, Philosophy at USC | Kleiner Perkins Fellow 2022 | Incoming SWE Intern at Two Sigma | President at TroyLabs | Previously at Slack Data Structures and Object-Oriented Design CSCI-104 Discrete Methods in Computer Science CSCI-170 Growth Hacking BAEP-469 Organizational Behavior and Leadership BUAD-304 Typography DES-332A 6 2020 Volunteer ProductNation/iSPIRT https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFBki_qTsGWBg/company-logo_400_400/0/1606809756249?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=V5aqfD4ML6leXfGHJLoFBqR9l0-V_nkDsk8K_sj3hhw https://www.linkedin.com/company/ispirt/ SCIENCE_AND_TECHNOLOGY iSPIRT is a non-profit think-tank that evangelizes and develops societal tech platforms for developing countries

In this capacity I manage a team of product managers through all parts of operating an at-scale internet product - ideation, backlog prioritization, spec development, feature implementation, release management, tuning, data analysis, feature readouts, data-driven investigations, and feature iteration. I have been a people manager since 2017. 

My experience has taught me to be as enthusiastic about the strategic pieces of product management as the weeds of execution in order to deliver excellent results. I believe in defining goals clearly up front and holding that goal as a north star through the development process. By partnering closely with stakeholders across levels and disciplines, I have developed crisp communication, thick skin, and a strong ability to recall facts. Above all, I strive to be resilient and empathetic as a colleague and a leader.

I'm a first-generation (soon-to-be-grad) college student.

I've been drumming since the 4th grade - nowadays I like to make drum tracks to jam to. 

I've been playing volleyball since 9th grade - nowadays I play recreationally with friends.

Education and mentorship are both really important to me. I've been teaching all throughout college and plan on staying involved in some way beyond graduation. I'm very thankful to all of those who have played a huge role in my life in these regards; opportunities have come and been created, and my life has changed quite a few times in ways I would have never imagined possible growing up.

✉️ We matched users to their ideal pen pal based on the interests they indicated, and based on their personality, which we determined using machine learning to analyze their most recent Twitter tweets. Once matched, pen pals have the ability to create customized letters and upload videos to send each other (with a delay in time based on their real-life locations), to replicate the feeling of sending real mail.

My end goal is to work on stuff that actively helps to improve people’s lives, and I apply that filter when choosing the teams I work on.

I moved to SF with the goal of working somewhere I can make a clear difference - I've worked + been building products + organizations for a while, and I'm looking to do more!

I’m currently working on Climate Tech at Watershed, and I love it. Still happy to consult / advise on ideas of all kinds, but I’m not looking for a new job!

Interests: Finance, Healthcare, Climate Tech, and Education - but open to anything that will help other people (intentionally vague).

Feel free to message me on LinkedIn or email me directly (ronak.manish.shah@gmail.com).

I like working with people because faster feedback and alignment push me forward and give me more confidence over the strength of the design. Communication, feedback, and inclusivity are at the core of my design. 

👉 I'm looking forward to work in an energetic company where I can continue to grow my knowledge and work on product that help people have a better life. 

I am continuing my education at the Minerva University, an innovative undergraduate university that highlights problem solving. I have traveled to six world cities to work with different organizations and identify sustainable ways to solve problems.

Longer bio——
Chia Amisola is an internet / ambient artist. Their (web)site-specific art explores web worldmaking to construct spaces, systems, and tools imagining a world where creation is synonymous with liberation. They are a Filipino tech worker, the Founder of Developh, a community of practice towards critical technology based in Manila, Philippines since 2016, and are the Steward & Archivist of the Philippine Internet Archive. Their work uses strategies of defaults, compression, and infrastructure-building to explore the politics of ambiences & visibilities and poetic reclamations of technology in its love, labor, and liberty.

They did not adequately inform me of financial aid coverage, denied to offer me financial assistance for extreme extenuating circumstances that they had offered other scholars, and redirected me to 'mentorship resources' as a 'substitute' for financial aid. If you are in legitimate financial need, IEEE & Adobe distribute their assistance extremely late — if your institution charges additional late fees, you will not be covered in time and will have to face the burden of these fees. Adobe & IEEE are incredibly uncooperative, will acknowledge your extenuating circumstances, and then refuse contact with you for an entire month. Their staff was incredibly rude and dismissive in our exchanges, and the program faced several employee turnovers in a span of two years—if that is any additional indicator. They are not interested in assisting students with actual financial need and are moreso interested in tax cuts.

Even Palantir was better at distributing financial assistance than Adobe.

I couldn't stand the humidity so I went to college in California (UCLA). When I first came to campus, I found myself standing in front of Jackie Robinson's statue every day. I could not get over the idea that alumni like him had walked the same steps as me when they were my age. That made me realize that I was in an environment where anything was possible, so I dared to dream big. 

At that time, four years ago, I had to work at Wendy's because I was rejected by every tech company I applied to. Since then, I’m fortunate to have been a leader of a fast-growing YC startup, a Fellow of the Kleiner Perkins venture capital firm, and a backend engineer at Robinhood during its brightest days.  These achievements are just the first few steps of the mountain I want to climb.

Why am I doing this? Because the best experience of my life happened when I was deeply inspired by an idea, and gave it my undivided focus for four years through disheartening failure and rejuvenating success. My career journey made me realize that I wanted to pursue an entirely new approach to life — one where I would strive to be my best in everything important to me, like developing my physique and being a great boyfriend. Through my life journey, I want everyone to experience more out of their own lives. We only live for 100 years, but the mark we leave on the world is permanent. 

I’m far from achieving that life approach, and I don’t know what my future looks like. But the end result isn’t that important to me. I just want to be able to look back knowing I took each action intentionally, made the tougher decision when it was right, and lived life in a way that I can be proud of.

That is what defines me, Yash Moondhra.

Mallet instruments have the same layout as a piano, but there were no online applications that allow you to use your keyboard as a mallet instrument in a user-friendly way. For my IB Computer Science Internal Assessment, I used Java to create a virtual xylophone, marimba, piano, and vibraphone which I could play using the keys on my laptop. Creating it myself allowed me to add features that I personally found useful, and organize the keys in a way that made sense in terms of the music I was playing. standardizedContributor Yash Moondhra Building the #1 crypto tax platform | ex-CTO @ Duffl (YC W20) Marimba: Pirates of the Caribbean 11 2016 5 2017 I came across a piano medley of Pirates of the Caribbean on YouTube in tenth grade and was inspired to learn the entire song. I spent hours in front of my keyboard piano, which I bought solely to learn the masterpiece. However, as someone who had never played piano before, I could not play the song even after my many hours of practice. In my senior year, I rediscovered this song with my friend, Joseph Quatela, and we realized we could play the song using four mallets on two marimbas, which is like having eight fingers. We encountered many difficulties in learning this piece, because many of the rhythms and chords were extremely uncomfortable to play on a marimba. Every day after my meetings after school, I would spend at least two hours practicing. During my academic classes, if I had already completed the project at hand, I would go practice marimba. After I graduated, I came back to school roughly four times a week solely to play the instrument. And finally, during the summer, we accomplished our goal. standardizedContributor Yash Moondhra Building the #1 crypto tax platform | ex-CTO @ Duffl (YC W20) 91127897 Awaken (Crypto tax software that actually works) https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D560BAQFMO3-y5XjbNA/company-logo_400_400/0/1680810224865?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=L3JTNBpyLgZJnRAHXLmxgnLt0vDzWqITgwb9eSa_FAU https://www.linkedin.com/company/awaken-tax/ 2 10 2 2022 2 2022 Awaken Awaken is the best crypto tax software on the market for consumers.

In one of the lunch breaks, my music teacher showed us a song called ""Stubernic"", in which three musicians played on a single marimba. I was shocked by how the trio walked around each other while playing complex polyrhythms. Throughout the song, I had one constant thought: ""I have to learn this."" However, I was not close to ready, as I had no experience playing with four mallets. In preparation for Stubernic, I learned ""Yellow After The Rain"". Stubernic is ranked in the highest difficulty category for high school marimba music by the Florida Bandmasters Association. I performed it as a sophomore at my band's concert. In senior year, I revisited the masterpiece and performed it at the state-level, receiving the highest ratings possible. standardizedContributor Yash Moondhra Building the #1 crypto tax platform | ex-CTO @ Duffl (YC W20) 11 2015 9 2017 Gift Shop Volunteer Baptist Health Boca Raton Regional Hospital https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E0BAQG8Hvv04XyDHw/company-logo_400_400/0/1685974104135?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=O_5QibGNopZWUeFG55j_Mu_9vm5H2YdU2dVki8kq9dQ https://www.linkedin.com/company/boca-raton-regional-hospital/ When my mom was hospitalized, I realized how important family, friends, and staff are to a person's recovery.

We designed and developed a platform and intelligent algorithm to increase the efficiency of housekeepers. By factoring in room vacancy, guest location, check in/out status and other pre-existing Hilton data, the algorithm can create and update a live list of rooms for housekeepers to visit, saving (on average) 92 hours of transition time a month.

It provides real time data on areas that have been searched, allowing rescuers to tag space with relevant information. The goal is to prevent duplication of effort and maximize number of lives saved.

Girl Scout's of Greater Los Angeles 10 2014 MLB Advanced Media Challenge 11 2016 11 2016 In an effort to increase the personalization of the customer's experience at the ballpark, my team and I created an additional facet to the already built ""MLB Ballpark"" app. Using augmented reality we created the wireframe of an interface a user can interact with on top of a live camera feed (similar to Pokémon GO). This would include scanning the field and being able to tap on players and get instant information, or walking around the ballpark and seeing various virtual items pop up on the camera footage screen to then click for more information. And to keep user's retained during the off-season, allowing users to scan player's favorite restaurants or places to go, receive points and then a perk before the season begins. At the conclusion of the project we pitched our idea to MLBAM's employees.  standardizedContributor Pippa Thomas Product Manager at Instacart 2732417 Instacart https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHF65cU34mbxw/company-logo_400_400/0/1648482785824?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=4NXDJ8gUXg6qgp4Q3gNA1eXShP5trTQ2NtynKjl_TX0 https://www.linkedin.com/company/instacart/ 1001 5000 7 2020 San Francisco, California, United States 6 2022 Instacart Alcohol, gifting, emerging business Product Manager Full-time Microsoft Office Java Computer Science Public Speaking Coding Languages Computer Hardware Educational Technology Python True 1375 500 mkokot Michael Kokot Product @ Instacart https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQESmaLnlSA3tA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1583337498322?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=KfIFM6II1gnsvJcAaFuK-s8QDurtkCn-M8yEITRkJac elizabethcreichert Elizabeth C.

I dream of a better world and pursue problems that stand in the way.  I ask many questions, and challenge the solutions I encounter - constructively I promise.

Interested in: future of work, fintech, social networks

After graduating from college w/BSc Computer Science :
--I worked on fintech projects that impact millions for the Gates Foundation
--Been a consultant, salesperson,product manager in cloud @ Cisco & fintech, ethical hacker...
--early employee at startup connecting African firms to investors -where I pitched 100s of farmers, government officials, and millionaires

Finally, I want my work to have an impact and love teams willing to take a moonshot at the world's hardest problems - because I know how it feels to lack opportunities to be your best.

After the wildfires in California and now the wildfires in Australia, we were interested in how we could do our part to mitigate as much danger and get as many people and animals the help they need.

What it does:
NotiFire is a multi-platform app that uses crowdsourced data from users and Twitter to display information about animals/people in need, help centers, and the active location of fires on the map. There is a mobile version where users can upload information about animals/people in trouble and view the map on the go. Additionally, there is a web version where users can, in more detail, view the map with all of its information.

How we built it:
We used Python and the FastAPI Framework to develop a backend API for both platforms. We then used Flutter to create the mobile version of the app and ReactJS to create the web version. Some of the technologies we utilized include the Google Maps API, Breezometer API, and Google Image Recognition API.

Challenges we ran into:
It was hard trying to create both mobile and web versions of the app. There was a learning curve to picking up the new APIs and backend framework. We definitely spent most of our time on the frontend, trying to get the data to load on the map and read from our backend API. standardizedContributor Lucas Rollo Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | Honors CS @ Texas A&M CloseCash (HackRice Winner) 9 2019 9 2019 Inspiration:
For a lot of us, ATMs seem to be far away when we need them the most. People who are serviced by local banks often can't find familiar ATMs to withdraw from if they can find one at all. For the 3 of us personally, we are tired of paying extra fees and borrowing money from friends. We'd like to get the cash we need when we need it. That's why we thought of creating a peer-to-peer ATM system that matches receivers and tellers to each other based on location and price, all thanks to Capital One and Google's API.

What it does:
Allows users that need close cash to match with tellers that are ranked in a list based on location and amount of cash on hand. The application consists of a receiver and teller interface, your most recent transaction, and a ranked search for the closest teller.

How we built it:
The app was built using Node.js/MongoDB in the backend and ReactJS in the front end. We utilized Capital One's API to create and use customer ids to make transactions in the application. Additionally, we used the Google Maps API to find a users location for the searching and ranking algorithm. Lastly, we made heavy use of Passport.js, Sessions, Cookies, and Axios to secure user data and communicate between multiple servers.

Challenges we ran into:
Initially, we planned for too many features and we're heavily stressing over getting it all done. After innovating and figuring out what features really matter, we were able to spend more time on debugging big issues and developing a robust system. Some of the big technical problems we faced had to do with sending Cookies and Sessions from the back-end to the front-end, learning ReactJS for an elegant UI, and interacting with both the APIs we used.

What we learned:
We learned a ton about MERN stack development and working with a separate front-end and back-end server. Most of our project consisted of technologies we had never used before such as ReactJS, Google Maps API, Capital One API, and other JS packages. standardizedContributor Lucas Rollo Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | Honors CS @ Texas A&M 18311685 Moveworks https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFiEwMbt6hJrQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1568244969590?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=gsCEvnyn9Tq2nvUbKgdLVQck6Tqzwua3C3_UVpFV6os https://www.linkedin.com/company/moveworksai/ 501 1000 1 2022 Mountain View, California, United States 6 2022 Moveworks Product Manager, Integrations & Extensibility  Full-time Product Management Web Development Python C++ Logo Design Marketing Branding & Identity HTML True 709 500 ajayrajmerchia Ajay Merchia Group Product Manager @ Moveworks | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | CS + Haas, UC Berkeley https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQG31qfdyRtzyA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1637075395115?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=HpNhwa0rBbgLQfBDRh8vgfFwOxgRr85UujmkEAadj_0 fadynaeim Fady Naeim Product @ Moveworks https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5603AQESFzy14LILzQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1673448774726?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=aoXCrNrZnVHImqHfxGvjB10JnBEku7A-C4YzxDJgLwE anakp525 Ana Parra Product @ Moveworks 👩🏻🪄💻 https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D03AQF-TLWPr2f5kg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1647901018380?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=IV2KCJV8yN6YrXnw9K95mD0L7BjLmPjMuSwMSmlYw_8 karenzxy XinYi(Karen) Zheng Product @ Uber | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | CS + Business @ UPenn M&T https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQGnYcRiliRwHQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1655795930990?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=qD2Uh_IRd_7i_5uA2Yt7p5q9jYc7rKSMF-cRs9T3U5M oliver-zou Oliver Zou Product @ Uber yatinag Yatin Agarwal Product @ Moveworks | CS @ UC Berkeley https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQFvGEbsxmmSWQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1593822459727?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=Agtdzj10mbyZw7WsE666jFSjbImkuE3FBpRR1eT5zMM charlesmjenkins C.J.

With a team of 2 sophomores and a freshman, we have struggled with gaining ""relevant experience"" for internship opportunities. It's also very difficult to learn the numerous technologies it takes to build a successful application on top of school work and extra-curriculars. That's why we wanted to build a fast-paced and short-term developer matching app to allow students at Texas A&M to quickly start projects together based on their shared interests and skills.

What it does:
Matches student developers to each other and encourages collaboration on projects. This was specifically implemented by using a ""discover"" page where you can briefly read about fellow devs and decide if you'd like to work with them. If a match is found, a live chat will open so more details can be shared and a project can be done. The concept and UI are very lean so students are encouraged to act fast and take their projects seriously.

How we built it:
We used Node.js/Express.js/MongoDB for the backend and HTML/Sass/EJS for the front-end. We also implemented libraries like Passport and Google OAuth 2.0 for secure login. Additionally, we had a big focus on ease-of-use UI so we heavily depended on Socket.io and EJS templates to create highly dynamic webpages. standardizedContributor Lucas Rollo Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | Honors CS @ Texas A&M BestFit (Aggies Invent Winner) 12 2018 8 2019 BestFit is a mobile and web app concept that allows users to accurately try on clothes for themselves and friends virtually. The app utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) to allow users to create an accurate 3D model of themselves and then have the ability to search for and try on clothes for an elevated retail experience. 

Our concept won 2nd place at Aggies Invent in December 2018 and has continued development since. We also be competed at the Engineering Project Showcase in April 2019.

Currently, the team consists of 3 engineering students with a wide variety of skills and abilities.
